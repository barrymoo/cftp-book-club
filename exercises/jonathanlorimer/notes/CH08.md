1. (pg. 90): A Bifunctor is a functor with 2 type arguments i.e. a mapping from a cartesian product of categories to a third category `C x D -> E`. If a type constructor is functorial in both its arguments then it is guaranteed to be functorial as a whole.
2. (pg. 92): "One of the requirements of a monoidal category is that the binary operator be a bifunctor."
