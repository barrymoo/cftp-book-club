1. (pg. 71): A functor is a mapping between categories; it maps objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms.
2. (pg. 72): "Functors must preserve the structure of the category"
3. (pg. 75,76): The functor laws prove that the structure of the category has been preserved:

```haskell
fmap id = id
fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g
```

4. (pg. 80): A functor in haskell / programming is any unary type constructor because it maps a type `a` to the type `f a`.
5. (pg. 82): Functions can be types, hence the reader functor `(->) a`
